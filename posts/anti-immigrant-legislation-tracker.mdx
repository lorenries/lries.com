  alt: President Trump's anti-immigrant agenda â€” tracking where things stand in Congress
---

This is a project that I designed and built for WOLA to track the Trump Administration's anti-immigrant agenda in Congress. It's an interactive piece that's divided into four sections: the Wall, Border Patrol, ICE, and DACA. Each section provides an overview of what the proposal would accomplish, what the White House wants, what's happening in Congress, and the overall prospects for approval.

There's a lot of information here, and we wanted to break up the content into more digestible chunks.

The "backend" is stored in a Google Sheet that non-technical program staff can update regularly, and is pulled into the website and converted into HTML markup with [Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop).
