Here's a data visualization I made in an [Observable notebook](https://beta.observablehq.com/@lorenries/history-of-nuclear-explosions) that maps all 2622 nuclear explosions that have occured on Planet Earth since July 15, 1945, when the United States first detonated a 20 kiloton bomb at a test site in New Mexico:

I've been fascinated recently with prototyping code and doing data visualization in [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/). It's a really interesting way to think about writing javascript _reactively_â€”where changing a variable will instantly and automatically update all of the other notebook cells that rely on that variable. Program and cell outputs are immediately visible in the notebook format, and notebooks are shareable and forkable by default. It's a powerful way to code and I highly recommend Mike Bostock's [post on the topic](https://medium.com/@mbostock/a-better-way-to-code-2b1d2876a3a0).
